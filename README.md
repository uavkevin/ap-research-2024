<h1>Brief Overview</h1>
<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is <b>Kevin</b>. As of writing this, I am currently <b>16 years old</b> and a <b>junior</b> in high school. I'm taking <b>AP Research</b>, and
this school year, I'm going to research how the usage of A.I. in video games will affect player stimulation, such as how their opinion 
of the game will change, how their experience will change, or how engagement statistics will change.</p>

The purpose of this experimental research is to look at how these trends change as a result of using A.I. to create 
video game assets such as character design, audio design, visual effects, terrain generation, and many others.</p>
